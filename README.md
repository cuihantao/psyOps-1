# psyOps (sī- ŏps) 
Power System Operations

Goal
Create a well-documented, easy to learn, power flow and analysis toolkit for professional power systems engineers.  Not intended to replace tools like PSS/e, PowerWorld and TARA.  Rather intended to validate the results of those projects, create a toolbox to leverage those systems and make your job as a power systems engineer easier.

Objectives
1. Provide a well-documented, open source power flow analysis toolset.
2. Wrap and extend psspy, the PSS/e Python library.
3. Create a hacky PowerGEM TARA (AMB and PAAC) interface.
4. Evolve into a gold standard power flow analysis toolset built and maintained by engineers for the good of engineers.

Target Deliverables
1. Fast, Newton-Raphson power flow engine.  Solve very large power systems models quickly.
2. CIM and PSS/e compatibility: read CIM, raw, save, idev, inch and other files standard to the grid operators in North America.
3. Basic model management.  Not a full-fledged model builder, just the basics needed to make the tools useful.
4. Extend psspy.  Psspy is a python library for PSS/e that is provided by Siemens PTI with their PSS/e product.  This project will not modify psspy, but will create extension libraries that depend on psspy for interactions with PSS/e.  
5. Write CIM compliant models and output.

Stretch Deliverables
1. PSS/e <-> CIM model conversion.
2. Advanced tools for security analysis, economic dispatch and more.
3. Advanced model management tools like 2 <-> 3 winding conversion.
4. Mapper tool to identify model changes and attempt to reconcile those changes.  Potential methods include node/equipment hybrid mapping.  Node to mode mapping.  Auto identify which nodes can be identified as common.  Equipment mapping.  Identify which equipment can be identified as common.  Provide three user mapping tools: node-to-node, equipment-to-equipment and node/equipment.
